# CaTDD method prompt

**Short name**: CaTDD (Comment-alive Test-Driven Development)

This file is the main entry point and stable contract for CaTDD. Keep it short enough for humans to read. Detailed method material lives in sibling subtopic files named `CaTDD_methodPrompt-*.md`.

## Purpose

CaTDD turns design intent into executable tests by writing structured living comments first, then evolving those comments into RED/GREEN tests and production code.

`Comment-alive` means:

- Design details live in the test and source file as structured comments.
- Comments evolve with code instead of drifting in separate documents.
- Comments are first-class artifacts that humans and LLMs can parse.
- US/AC/TC structure bridges human intent and machine-executable tests.

## Design Skeleton Contract

In CaTDD, **design** means a reusable comment skeleton inside the test or source file, not only an external explanation document.

Each skeleton is organized by:

- **Class**: the priority family, such as `P0 Functional`, `P1 Design`, `P2 Quality`, or `P3 Addons`.
- **Category**: the specific verification angle, such as `Typical`, `Edge`, `Misuse`, `Fault`, `State`, `Capability`, `Interaction`, `Concurrency`, `Performance`, `Robust`, `Compatibility`, `Configuration`, `Diagnosis`, `Security`, or `Demo/Example`.

Minimum skeleton shape:

```text
//=================================================================================================
// [Class] / [Category] Design Skeleton
//=================================================================================================
// @[Class]: P0 Functional / ValidFunc
// @[Category]: Typical
// @[Intent]: What this category proves for this component
// @[UseWhen]: When this category applies
// @[AvoidWhen]: When to move the scenario to another category
// @[US]: User Story IDs covered by this category
// @[AC]: Acceptance Criteria IDs covered by this category
// @[TC]: Test Cases, status, and expected TDD next action
//=================================================================================================
```

For full structure guidance, read `CaTDD_methodPrompt-testStructure.md`.

## Category Semantics

CaTDD categories are not labels added after tests are written. They are:

- Thinking lenses before design: what kind of confidence does this test provide?
- Routing rules during skeleton creation: which category file owns this test point?
- Review gates before implementation: what source artifact justifies this test?

The class names define the verification lens:

| Class | Confidence Lens | Core Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 Functional | Contract | Does the user-visible contract behave correctly? |
| P1 Design | Model | Does the internal state, capability, interaction, or concurrency model hold? |
| P2 Quality | Envelope | Does the behavior remain acceptable under quality constraints? |
| P3 Addons | Learning Surface | Does the demo, example, or guide remain executable and useful? |

`P0/P1/P2/P3` gives the default verification order, not absolute business priority. Risk may move a category earlier in execution order, but it does not rename or reclassify the test.

Category fine in place: choose the category by verification lens, then adjust execution order by risk.

For full category guidance, read `CaTDD_methodPrompt-categorySemantics.md`.

## Mandatory Traceability Constraints

- P0 Functional design must include the full category set in order: `Typical -> Edge -> Misuse -> Fault` unless the developer explicitly limits scope.
- Each US must map to at least one AC.
- Each AC must map to at least one TC.
- Design output must declare the SUT explicitly in the test-file overview section, for example `SUT: utCodeAgentCLI`.
- Every non-empty category file must trace to a source-of-truth artifact.
- If the source is missing, ask the developer or mark the category file with `@[NoTestPoints]: <reason>`; do not invent test points.

## Category Source-of-Truth Gate

Use the category's source artifact to decide whether a test point is valid.

| Class | Category Family | Primary Source of Truth | Missing Source Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 Functional | Typical / Edge / Misuse / Fault | User Story, Acceptance Criteria, UsageDesign, API contract | Ask for AC/usage contract or mark `@[NoTestPoints]` |
| P1 Design | State / Capability / Interaction / Concurrency | ArchDesign, DetailDesign, StateDesign, sequence or interaction diagrams | Ask where the design model lives before drafting tests |
| P2 Quality | Performance / Robust / Compatibility / Configuration / Diagnosis / Security | PerfDesign, ResourceDesign, CompatDesign, ErrorDesign, DiagnosisDesign, SecurityDesign, threat model, VerifyDesign | Ask for measurable constraints, compatibility rules, diagnostic evidence, security policy, or config matrix |
| P3 Addons | Demo/Example | UserGuide, README examples, demo scripts | Ask for executable example intent or mark `@[NoTestPoints]` |

## Workflow Summary

1. Capture Stage-0 free drafts: scenarios, examples, risks, and open questions.
2. Classify drafts into CaTDD categories using the verification lens and source-of-truth gate.
3. Write US/AC/TC comments before implementing code.
4. Pick one TC and write the test first.
5. Run the test and confirm RED for the intended reason.
6. Implement the minimum production code to make the TC GREEN.
7. Refactor comments, test code, and production code while preserving behavior.
8. Repeat one TC at a time.

Default execution order:

| Order | Categories |
| --- | --- |
| P0 Functional | Typical -> Edge -> Misuse -> Fault |
| P1 Design | State -> Capability -> Interaction -> Concurrency |
| P2 Quality | Performance -> Robust -> Compatibility -> Configuration -> Diagnosis -> Security |
| P3 Addons | Demo/Example |

For detailed execution gates, read `CaTDD_methodPrompt-workflow.md`.

## File Naming Contract

Use this pattern for category-specific test files:

```text
test_{feature}_{category}.<ext>
```

- `{feature}` should be a stable lower_snake_case capability slice derived from module-interface usage scenarios.
- `{category}` must use a canonical CaTDD filename token.
- Start with `test_{feature}_freelyDrafts.<ext>` for exploration, then classify mature test points into category-specific files.
- Each `{feature}` should have one file for every canonical category token.
- If a category has no applicable test points, keep that file as a living decision with `@[NoTestPoints]: <reason>` and no executable TCs.
- Empty-by-omission is forbidden.

Canonical tokens:

| CaTDD class/category | Filename token |
| --- | --- |
| P0 Functional / ValidFunc / Typical | `funcValidTypical` |
| P0 Functional / ValidFunc / Edge | `funcValidEdge` |
| P0 Functional / InvalidFunc / Misuse | `funcInvalidMisuse` |
| P0 Functional / InvalidFunc / Fault | `funcInvalidFault` |
| P1 Design / State | `designState` |
| P1 Design / Capability | `designCapability` |
| P1 Design / Interaction | `designInteraction` |
| P1 Design / Concurrency | `designConcurrency` |
| P2 Quality / Performance | `qualityPerformance` |
| P2 Quality / Robust | `qualityRobust` |
| P2 Quality / Compatibility | `qualityCompatibility` |
| P2 Quality / Configuration | `qualityConfiguration` |
| P2 Quality / Diagnosis | `qualityDiagnosis` |
| P2 Quality / Security | `qualitySecurity` |
| P3 Addons / Demo/Example | `addonDemoExample` |

For detailed naming examples, read `CaTDD_methodPrompt-fileNaming.md`.

## Category Prompt Deep Dives

Use category-specific prompts when designing a category skeleton.

| Category | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Typical | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Typical.md` |
| Edge | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Edge.md` |
| Misuse | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Misuse.md` |
| Fault | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Fault.md` |
| State | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-State.md` |
| Capability | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Capability.md` |
| Interaction | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Interaction.md` |
| Concurrency | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Concurrency.md` |
| Performance | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Performance.md` |
| Robust | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Robust.md` |
| Compatibility | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Compatibility.md` |
| Configuration | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Configuration.md` |
| Diagnosis | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Diagnosis.md` |
| Security | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-Security.md` |
| Demo/Example | `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-DemoExample.md` |

## Non-Negotiable Agent Rules

- Do not skip design comments before implementation.
- Do not write production code before a failing test exists for the selected TC.
- Do not guess missing product intent, acceptance criteria, source-of-truth design, or quality thresholds.
- Do not silently omit a category file.
- Do not reclassify a test because risk changed execution order.
- Do not expand a TC during refactor beyond its original AC meaning.

## Maintenance Rule

When CaTDD method intent changes:

1. Update this main entry if the stable contract changes.
2. Update the matching `CaTDD_methodPrompt-*.md` subtopic for detailed guidance.
3. Update `README_UserGuide.md` and `README_UserGuide_ZH.md` if standalone users need to see the change.
4. Update category-specific `CaTDD_methodPrompt4Cat-*.md` only when a single category's deep guidance changes.
